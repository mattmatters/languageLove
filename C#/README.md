# [C#](https://www.microsoft.com/net)

I'm not much of a Microsoft person, and most of this was compiled using open source software.  But I figured it was a decent idea to familiarize myself with C# for different enterprise company positions.  While I don't have any more plans to continue exploring this language, I do believe that this is a fairly decent one.

The type system is fairly easy to get a grasp of.  It supports static type systems and casting is fairly obvious and well laid out.

While I have not spent enough time to say for sure, Object Oriented Programming seems to be this language's bread and butter, with inheritence, encapsulation, etc being supported.

## Running
Install mono and mcs then type

```sh
mcs hello.cs
mono hello.exe
```
