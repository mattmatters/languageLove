# [PHP](https://secure.php.net/)

More than half of currently live web applications are being powered by PHP.  While people's complaints against the language are [numerous](https://whydoesitsuck.com/why-does-php-suck/), that does not change the fact that most web developers will have to use the language at some point in their career.

## Running

Install the [PHP](https://php.net/) compiler and type into your shell:

To compile the index page into html type:
```sh
php index.php > index.html
```

You can also run the other scripts by running the compiler on them. For example with hello.php
```sh
php hello.php
```

You could pipe the output into an HTML file or do whatever you like with it. The world is your oyster, and PHP is a clam.
