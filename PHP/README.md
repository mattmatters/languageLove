PHP is a silly language, that has little place in the technology world going forward.  That being said it still powers more than half of currently live web applications.  Therefore it is a necessity to at least have a rudimentary understanding of the language and its syntax.

## Running

Install the [PHP](https://php.net/) compiler and type into your shell:

```sh
php index.php
```

You could pipe the output into an HTML file or do whatever you like with it. The world is your oyster, and PHP is a clam.
