# Elm
Elm is basically what happens when we build a client oriented language focusing around pure functional programming.  The web application architecture is the same as how most of these types of languages handle immutable state.  This is a functional Flux architecture on steroids.

## Installation
```sh
elm package install
elm-reactor
```

Now head to localhost:8000 and select the file you want to compile.
